The `hpatches_facade_pairs.csv` file contains 20 planar correspondences created by
projecting a regular grid with the public HPatches-style homography

```
[ [1.042, -0.003, -12.4],
  [0.006, 1.038,   3.1],
  [0.00001, -0.00002, 1.0] ]
```

onto the target view. Coordinates are expressed in pixels to mirror the homography
benchmarks released with HPatches.
